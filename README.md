## Thesis-Diploma-Project-Design-of-analog-filters-for-speech-signs-processing
#This is my diploma thesis on Design of analog filters for speech signs processing. I owe many thanks to my supervisor Assistant Professor Georgia Tsirimokou , for her guidance and support throughout this journey. In the project , I worked on the implementation of an analog filter that mimics the function of the vocal tube. In order to create and simulate this circuit , I used Cadence IC Design Tools.
